                    <h1>Profile</h1>
                    <p class="para-1"My name is Brendan Richards. I am 45 years old and live in the city of Hereford. I have been teaching primary school pupils for the past fifteen years but have been itching to change career for the past three years!></p><br>I began my teaching career in 2003, teaching in Redditch, Worcestershire, where I taught for four years, teaching a class of 7 and 8 year olds.  In 2007, I relocated to Herefordshire where I have taught year 10 and 11 year olds until last week!<br>Before I began my teaching career I was employed as an account manager in fresh produce.  I worked on multiple accounts with Asda, Safeway(now Morrisons) and Somerfield. </p>

                    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                    <p class="para-2">My hobbies mainly take place outdoors.  I have been a keen walker for many years, mainly hill walking in Herefordshire and also venturing into Wales, the Lake District and even as far as Scotland!<br>Camping has also been a bit part of my life, beginning in my childhood when our family holidays would be a weeks vaction in some remote part of Wales. Sometimes we would be lucky if there was a water tap.  These days I still camp with my family, although things have changed now as we only choose campsites that have toilets!<br>I also enjoy cycling, especially mountain biking, which when I have the time, I like to explore the woods and hills of the welsh borders.

                    <p>I have been married for the past 17 years to Natalie, a self-employed programme manager.  Natalie is the person who has encouraged me to pursue my dream of working within the I.T industry.  With her help and support I believe that I will be a success in transfering in my skills, as well as gaining new skills, to help me succeed in my future career.<img src="images/Theatre.jpg" alt="Natalie and Brendan picture" width="200" height="200"/><br>We have a daughter, Etain, who is 15 years old.<br><img src="images/pictureofetain.jpeg"
                        " alt="picture of Etain" width="200" height="200"/>Etain is a very keen dancer, and dreams of one day performing in the West End.  She is a memeber of The Hereford Academy of Dance and trains almost every night of the week.</p>
